% While embedding models have significantly enhanced RAG systems, several challenges persist:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Cross-Modal Alignment:} Improving alignment across diverse modalities (e.g., text, images, and speech).
%     \item \textbf{Benchmarks for Multi-Modal RAG:} Addressing the scarcity of comprehensive evaluation frameworks.
%     \item \textbf{Scalability and Interpretability:} Balancing computational efficiency and explainability of embeddings.
% \end{itemize}
