In this research plan, I propose Synthetic Hypothetical Document Training and Task Abstraction for Instruction-Based Fine-Tuning to enhance the performance of embedding models in RAG tasks. Synthetic Hypothetical Document Training uses large language models to generate data that enriches embeddings with multi-hop reasoning capabilities, while Task Abstraction introduces task-specific instructions to improve generalization and task adaptation. These methodologies aim to advance retrieval accuracy, semantic representation, and reasoning in embedding models, addressing key limitations in real-world applications.
