The objective of this research is to enhance the reasoning capacity of embedding models in RAG systems to improve semantic understanding, generalizability across complex tasks, and multi-hop reasoning. Current embedding models often struggle with the intricacies of reasoning over multiple documents, generalizing to diverse downstream tasks, and addressing challenges posed by complex tasks such as multi-hop reasoning, entity linking, and contextual integration. Furthermore, their reliance on extensive annotated data limits their scalability in real-world applications. This research aims to address these challenges by advancing embedding models to perform more robust semantic understanding and reasoning, enabling superior performance in retrieval accuracy, task adaptability, and diverse RAG scenarios.
