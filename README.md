# COMP6211J-Course-Report

This repository contains my course report for COMP6211J: Advanced Large-Scale Machine Learning System for Foundation Models (Fall 2025).

## Report Summary
This report provides an review of embedding model underpinning RAG pipelines, exploring different model architectures, training approaches, and evaluation benchmarks. It focus on understanding their critical role in enabling effective retrieval and generation. The report also introduces a research idea, together with a high-level research plan to enhance embedding models via synthetic hypothetical document training and task abstraction for instruction-based fine-tuning.
